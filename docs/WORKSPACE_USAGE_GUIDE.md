5. Create new folders as needed
6. Search for files using the search button

### For Parents

1. Open the Parent Dashboard
2. Select a student
3. Tap on the **"Materials"** button
4. Browse available resources (read-only access)
5. View and download files by tapping on them

### For Students

1. Access through the Parent Dashboard (when logged in as student)

## 📁 Folder Structure

The workspace is organized hierarchically with role-based access control:

### For Students and Parents:

```
SIS - [Branch Name]
├── Student Resources
│   ├── Textbooks
│   ├── Study Materials
│   └── Announcements
└── Homework
    ├── Class Assignments
    └── Individual Tasks
```

### For Teachers and Staff:

```
SIS - [Branch Name]
├── Student Resources
│   ├── Textbooks
│   ├── Study Materials
│   └── Announcements
├── Staff Resources
│   ├── Lesson Plans
│   ├── Administrative Documents
│   └── Training Materials
├── Administrative
│   ├── Policies
│   ├── Forms
│   └── Reports
└── Homework
    ├── Class Assignments
    └── Individual Tasks
```

**Access Control**: Each folder has specific access permissions based on user roles. Students and parents only see folders relevant to them, while teachers and staff have broader access.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Role-Based Access Control**

- Different user types see different content
- Permissions are enforced both in UI and backend
- Secure access to sensitive materials

### 2. **File Management**

- Upload multiple file types (PDF, Office docs, images, videos)
- Organize files in folders
- Search across all accessible content
- View recent files

### 3. **Google Drive Integration**

- Direct integration with Google Drive
- Files stored securely in Google Drive
- Web links for easy sharing
- Automatic file organization

### 4. **Mobile-Optimized UI**

- Responsive design for phones and tablets
- Touch-friendly interface
- Smooth navigation between folders
- Pull-to-refresh functionality

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Current Status

- ✅ **Mobile App**: Fully implemented with mock data
- ✅ **Service Layer**: Complete API integration ready
- ✅ **UI Components**: Responsive design for all devices
- ✅ **Permission System**: Role-based access control
- ⏳ **Backend API**: Ready for implementation
- ⏳ **Google Drive**: Awaiting service account setup

### Mock Data Mode

Currently running in **Demo Mode** with realistic mock data:

- Simulates real API responses
- Demonstrates all functionality
- Perfect for testing and development
- Easy switch to production mode

### Switching to Production

To connect to real Google Drive API:

1. Set `USE_MOCK_DATA = false` in `workspaceService.js`
2. Implement backend API endpoints
3. Configure Google Drive service accounts
4. Test with real data

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```javascript
// Import test runner
import { runWorkspaceTests } from '../utils/workspaceTestRunner';

// Run all tests
const results = await runWorkspaceTests();

// Quick functionality test
import { quickWorkspaceTest } from '../utils/workspaceTestRunner';
const isWorking = await quickWorkspaceTest();
```

### Test Coverage

- ✅ Service function tests
- ✅ Permission system tests
- ✅ File size limit tests
- ✅ Mock data functionality tests
- ✅ User type specific tests

## 📱 User Experience

### Navigation Flow

1. **Entry Points**:

   - Teacher Dashboard → Materials button
   - Parent Dashboard → Materials button (per student)

2. **Folder Navigation**:

   - Tap folders to enter
   - Back button to navigate up
   - Breadcrumb path display

3. **File Interaction**:

   - Long press for additional options (future)
   - Download links available

### UI Adaptations

- **Teachers**: Full functionality with upload/create buttons
- **Parents/Students**: Read-only interface, no action buttons
- **Responsive**: Adapts to phone/tablet screen sizes
- **Theme Support**: Light and dark mode compatible

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Files Not Loading**

   - Check network connection
   - Verify user permissions
   - Ensure mock data is enabled for testing

2. **Upload Failures**

   - Check file size limits
   - Verify file type is supported
   - Ensure user has upload permissions

3. **Permission Errors**
   - Verify user type is correct
   - Check role-based access settings
   - Ensure proper authentication

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by checking console output:

```javascript
// Look for these log prefixes:
// 🎭 WORKSPACE: Mock data operations
// 🔗 WORKSPACE: API requests
// ✅ WORKSPACE: Successful operations
// ❌ WORKSPACE: Error conditions
```
