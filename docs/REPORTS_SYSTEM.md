## Demo Mode

All report functions include comprehensive demo data for testing:

- Realistic sample data for all report types
- Proper chart data structures
- Summary statistics
- Subject breakdowns and top items

## Technical Details

### Chart Data Structure

```javascript
{
  type: 'doughnut' | 'bar',
  labels: ['Label1', 'Label2', ...],
  datasets: [{
    data: [value1, value2, ...],
    backgroundColor: ['#color1', '#color2', ...]
  }]
}
```

### Report Response Structure

```javascript
{
  success: true,
  report_type: 'report_type_name',
  data: {
    summary: { /* summary statistics */ },
    chart_data: { /* chart configuration */ },
    subject_breakdown: [ /* optional subject data */ ],
    top_items: [ /* optional top items */ ]
  }
}
```

### Error Handling

- Authentication validation
- Missing parameter checks
- Network error handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback to demo data when appropriate

## Testing

### Test File

- **Location**: `src/tests/reportsIntegration.test.js`
- **Coverage**: API service functions, error handling, data structure validation

### Manual Testing

1. Enable demo mode in the app
2. Navigate to reports from Teacher or Parent screens
3. Test all report types and interactions
4. Verify responsive design on different devices
5. Test error scenarios (no internet, invalid data)

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Date Range Filtering**: Complete implementation of date picker and filtering
2. **Export Functionality**: PDF/Excel export of reports
3. **Push Notifications**: Report-based notifications and alerts
4. **Offline Support**: Cache reports for offline viewing
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Trend analysis, predictions, comparisons

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Data Caching**: Implement report data caching
2. **Lazy Loading**: Load chart data on demand
3. **Image Optimization**: Optimize chart rendering performance
4. **Background Sync**: Sync report data in background

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Charts not displaying**: Check chart data structure and react-native-svg installation
2. **Demo data not loading**: Verify isDemoMode function and demo data functions
3. **Navigation errors**: Ensure all screens are properly registered in App.js
4. **API errors**: Check network connectivity and endpoint configuration
5. **Theme errors**: Fixed comprehensive theme access issues:
   - Moved `createStyles` call after theme validation
   - Added safety checks in all render functions that access `theme.colors`
   - Fixed shadow functions to receive theme parameter (`createSmallShadow(theme)`, `createMediumShadow(theme)`)
   - Prevents "Cannot read property 'colors' of undefined" errors completely

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting `console.log` statements in:

- `src/services/reportsService.js` - API calls and responses
- Chart components - Rendering and data processing
- Screen components - Navigation and state changes

## Dependencies

### Required Packages

- `react-native-svg` - Chart rendering
- `@react-navigation/native-stack` - Navigation
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` - Data persistence

### Optional Enhancements

- `react-native-date-picker` - Date range selection
- `react-native-share` - Export functionality
- `react-native-fs` - File system operations for exports

## Conclusion

The Mobile API Reports system is now fully integrated and ready for production use. The implementation provides a solid foundation for analytics and reporting capabilities while maintaining the app's existing design patterns and user experience standards.
